# crash-project
Reviving the language that brought us the Crash Bandicoot Series

This will essentially work similarly to [OPENGoal](https://github.com/open-goal) but for [GOOL](https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/03/12/making-crash-bandicoot-gool-part-9/) games.

The end goal is to have Crash 1-3 running natively on PC, and is a spiritual successor to [c2c](https://github.com/ughman/c2c) and [c1c](https://github.com/wurlyfox/c1c?tab=readme-ov-file) by [ughman](https://github.com/ughman) and [wurlyfox,](https://github.com/wurlyfox) and is inspired by [OpenGOAL.](https://opengoal.dev/)

Project Progress: 0%

> [!WARNING]
> **When the project is finally playable, do not use this decompilation project without providing your own legally purchased copy of the game.** We will ***not*** distribute any assets from the game - you will use your own legitimately obtained PS1 copy of the game. We will support every retail PAL, NTSC-U, and NTSC-J build, including Greatest Hits and Platinum Range copies.

Tools being used:

[gooc](https://github.com/mandude/gooc) by [mandude](https://github.com/ManDude) and [DankRank.](https://github.com/DankRank)

[crashutils](https://github.com/wurlyfox/crashutils) by [wurlyfox.](https://github.com/wurlyfox)

Current Task

Finish what mandude and DankRank started

Out current task is finishing GOOC, our main tool.

What is GOOC?

GOOC is open source version of GOOL with a C base. In the [goocdump](https://github.com/ManDude/goocdump), mandude (who does not like my project because i used a incorrect citation in a reddit post, he can go fuck himself for having a fit over that) there should be 3 games, and 3 for each regional version, so 9. But the only one finished is NTSC-J of the first Crash Bandicoot. I haven't fully tested the tool yet, but it should decompile the games, if we were to listen to him.

Progress: 1/9
