# crash-project
Reviving the language that brought us the Crash Bandicoot Series

This will essentially work similarly to OPENGOAL but for GOOL games.

The end goal is to have Crash 1-3 running natively on PC.

Progress: probably around 0%

dev note from jol: havent even started with decompiling
im still working on my earlier roth/normality project
