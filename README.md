# crash-project
Reviving the language that brought us the Crash Bandicoot Series

This will essentially work similarly to [OPENGoal](https://github.com/open-goal) but for [GOOL](https://all-things-andy-gavin.com/2011/03/12/making-crash-bandicoot-gool-part-9/) games.

The end goal is to have Crash 1-3 running natively on PC, and is a spiritual successor to [c2c](https://github.com/ughman/c2c) and [c1c](https://github.com/wurlyfox/c1c?tab=readme-ov-file) by [ughman](https://github.com/ughman) and [wurlyfox,](https://github.com/wurlyfox) and is inspired by [OpenGOAL.](https://opengoal.dev/)

Progress: probably around 0%

> [!WARNING]
> **When the project is finally playable, do not use this decompilation project without providing your own legally purchased copy of the game.** We will ***not*** distribute any assets from the game - you will use your own legitimately obtained PS1 copy of the game. We will support every retail PAL, NTSC-U, and NTSC-J build, including Greatest Hits and Platinum Range copies.
